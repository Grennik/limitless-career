                (And I thought my resume and cover letter were spotless, so I couldn't image why I wasn't getting any calls.)
                I knew the way I was heading in my career no longer suited me and my needs, but I

                After working with Ashley, I was able to learn new skills - or re-vamp exisiting ones - that
                made me feel confident in my resume and experience. Ashley helped me get clear about
                where my talents would be most effective, and map out a variety of paths to get me to <thead>
                most desired result. <special> This lead to SEVERAL interviews (and a few offers!) in the <underline>first month.</underline></special>

                Ashley is so passionate about what she does and I really felt like she geniunely wanted to
