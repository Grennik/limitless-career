            <p>
              More than anything, I felt completely alone.

            <p>
              Turns out, I wasn’t alone at all. In fact…

              75% of the U.S. population is hiding some part of their identity at work (Reuters).

              </li>
              <li>

            I tried talking to friends about my predicament, but somehow the conversation always turned back to them and <br>

            <special>Everyone, it seemed, was experiencing a crisis of their own</special> – and they wanted to know how I’d managed to triple <br>

              Pretty soon, my friends were asking if they could bring their <br>

              and she was accompanied by no less than eight of her friends <br>
              – all of them crammed around a tiny table.

              I faced the music, and I quit my job in D.C. Next, I moved home to L.A. The fear and uncertainty I’d been dodging <br>
              for so long caught up with me, and I felt like a complete failure.

              I reflected on the weeks in DC I spent as a job hunting and job-hopping master, and realized that it was the thrill <br>
              of the hunt – not the job itself – that lit me up and made me come alive.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
              Most of all, I loved feeling like I had job security. I became so great at networking that I realized I’d never worry <br>
              about my career again—I was always an email away from another job offer.

                Before working with Ashley in the Limitless Career Lab, I was <br>
                unsatisfied in the retail jobs I worked, but unable to move out <br>
                of these fields. I was supporting my filmmaking work out of <br>
                pocket, and not able to get a job in my field despite having a <br>
                BFA in film and a certificate in Digital Filmmaking. Most of all, <br>
                I was your typical disenfranchised millennial.
              </p>
              <p>
                After joining Ashley’s program, I was employed in the entertainment <br>
                industry working regular office hours- two things I previously thought <br>
                were incompatible! I also become very aware of an incredible number of opportunities in <br>
                my field- truly a mindset of abundance, and I no longer feel trapped in my current role. I am <br>
                now using my education, my talents, and working a job that I can honestly say I love.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm so glad I did this because Ashley's tips have stayed with me far beyond the course, and <br>
                have helped me not only in securing employment, but in my personal artistic endeavors as <br>
                well.  Her networking and job-hunting tips are timeless, but the course itself was highly <br>
                tailored to my individual needs at the time.  She helped me get past a huge professional <br>
                block, and my career has soared since taking the course.  I can't recommend her enough!

            I have spent years creating and perfecting the curriculum for Limitless <br>
            Career Lab, though my own experience, research and working with <br>
            hundreds of people as a career coach. As long as your are committed <br>
            (and do the work), this program will absolutely help you get results... <br>
            Which is why I happily offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. No <br>
            questions asked! I know you won't need or want it, but it's there for <br>
            your peace of mind.
